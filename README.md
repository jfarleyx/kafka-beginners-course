# kafka-beginners-course

Java application that produces and consumes data in Apache Kafka. Created as part of Stephane Maarek's Udemy course titled Learning Apache Kafka for Beginners v2. I highly recommend the course if you're new to Apache Kafka. 

This application will show you how to produce messages to Kafka, as well as consume messages from Kafka.
